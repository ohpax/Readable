# Readable 
Readable is a blog that I created as my first  React Redux project. In this website you can Create, Edit, comment and Vote posts.

# Get Started
For runing the website on your local machin, you need to clone this repository, install the npm packages using `npm install` command and run with `npm start` command.
Meanwile; you will need to run the backend part of this project which is provided with Udacity and works as the Rest Api for this project. You can find the server application [here](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter)
You will need to use the same command for the server application. 
Further details exist in its own repository which is located in the provided link.

# Contributing
You can always contribute to this project, if you really like it. But, I personally will not continue supporting it ;)
becuase I want to start working on more exciting projects.
