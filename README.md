# Readable 
Readable is a blog that I created as my first  React Redux project. In this website you can Create, Edit, comment and Vote posts.

# Get Started
For runing the website on your local machin, you need to clone this repository and run `npm start` .
Meanwile; you will need to run the backend part of this project which is provided with Udacity and works as the Rest Api for this project. You can find it [here](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter)

# Contributing
You can always contribute to this project, if you really like it. But, I personally will not continue supporting it ;)
becuase I want to start working on more exciting projects.
